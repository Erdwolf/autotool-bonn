\begin{slide}{\autotool\ as a verifier}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  ideally, problem is in NP (e.g. COL):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    student has to guess (N)
  \item
    \autotool\ has to check (P)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  sometimes solutiones are a bit longer (PCP)
\item
  or verification takes a bit longer 
  (equivalence of regular expressions)
\item
  sometimes verification is impossible,

  then replaced by testing (equivalence of CFG)
\end{itemize}

lots of opportunities to discuss with students
about decidability and complexity
